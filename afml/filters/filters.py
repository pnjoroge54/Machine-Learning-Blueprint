Filters are used to filter events based on some kind of trigger. For example a structural break filter can be
used to filter events where a structural break occurs. This event is then used to measure the return from the event
to some event horizon, say a day.

    The Symmetric Dynamic/Fixed CUSUM Filter.

    The CUSUM filter is a quality-control method, designed to detect a shift in the mean value of a measured quantity
    away from a target value. The filter is set up to identify a sequence of upside or downside divergences from any
    reset level zero. We sample a bar t if and only if S_t >= threshold, at which point S_t is reset to 0.

    One practical aspect that makes CUSUM filters appealing is that multiple events are not triggered by raw_time_series
    hovering around a threshold level, which is a flaw suffered by popular market signals such as Bollinger Bands.
    It will require a full run of length threshold for raw_time_series to trigger an event.

    Once we have obtained this subset of event-driven bars, we will let the ML algorithm determine whether the occurrence
    of such events constitutes actionable intelligence. Below is an implementation of the Symmetric CUSUM filter.

    Note: As per the book this filter is applied to closing prices but we extended it to also work on other
    time series such as volatility.

    :param raw_time_series: (pd.Series) Close prices (or other time series, e.g. volatility).
    :param threshold: (float or pd.Series) When the abs(change) is larger than the threshold, the function captures
                      it as an event, can be dynamic if threshold is pd.Series
    :param time_stamps: (bool) Default is to return a DateTimeIndex, change to false to have it return a list.
    :return: (datetime index vector) Vector of datetimes when the events occurred. This is used later to sample.
